# M6.1: MIDI Playback & Track Cleanup - Completion Report

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** October 29, 2025

---

## Overview

M6.1 fixed critical issues with MIDI clip playback and track cleanup that were preventing MIDI notes from playing and causing audio artifacts after track deletion.

---

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ MIDI Clip Playback
**Problem:** Notes entered in piano roll were not playing back during transport.

**Root Cause:** MIDI notes were only stored in Dart, not synced to the Rust audio engine timeline.

**Solution:**
- Bound FFI functions: `create_midi_clip_ffi`, `add_midi_note_to_clip_ffi`, `add_midi_clip_to_track_ffi`
- Created `_scheduleMidiClipPlayback()` to sync Dart notes to Rust clips
- Convert beats to seconds based on tempo for accurate playback

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/lib/audio_engine.dart` (+30 lines)
- `ui/lib/screens/daw_screen.dart` (+80 lines)
- `engine/src/api.rs` (+24 lines)
- `engine/src/audio_graph.rs` (+23 lines)

### ✅ Duplicate MIDI Clips Prevention
**Problem:** Every note edit created a new MIDI clip, causing overlapping duplicates in the arrangement view.

**Root Cause:** `_onMidiClipUpdated()` was generating new timestamp-based clip IDs for each edit instead of reusing the existing clip.

**Solution:**
- Added `_dartToRustClipIds` mapping to track Dart→Rust clip relationships
- Reuse existing clip when editing notes instead of creating new ones
- Added `clear_midi_clip_ffi()` to clear notes before updating

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/lib/screens/daw_screen.dart` (+60 lines)
- `engine/src/ffi.rs` (+8 lines)
- `engine/src/api.rs` (+15 lines)

### ✅ Stuck MIDI Notes After Track Deletion
**Problem:** Deleting a MIDI track left notes playing indefinitely (stuck note issue).

**Root Cause:** Track deletion didn't send note-off messages to active synthesizer voices.

**Solution:**
- Added `all_notes_off()` method to Synthesizer
- Call `all_notes_off()` when deleting tracks
- Ensures clean audio state on track removal

**Files Modified:**
- `engine/src/synth.rs` (+8 lines)
- `engine/src/api.rs` (+4 lines)

### ✅ MIDI Clips Playing After Track Deletion
**Problem:** MIDI clips continued to play even after their parent track was deleted.

**Root Cause:** Audio playback was reading from global `AudioGraph.midi_clips` collection, which wasn't cleaned up on track deletion.

**Solution:**
- Added `track_id` field to `TimelineMidiClip` structure
- Created `remove_midi_clips_for_track()` to filter clips by track
- Call cleanup function in `delete_track()` before removing track
- Added Dart-side cleanup in `_onTrackDeleted()` callback

**Files Modified:**
- `engine/src/track.rs` (+1 line)
- `engine/src/audio_graph.rs` (+10 lines)
- `engine/src/api.rs` (+15 lines)
- `ui/lib/screens/daw_screen.dart` (+22 lines)
- `ui/lib/widgets/mixer_panel.dart` (+2 lines)
- `ui/lib/widgets/track_mixer_panel.dart` (+2 lines)

### ✅ Debug Message Cleanup
**Problem:** Excessive console output cluttered the terminal during normal operation.

**Solution:**
- Removed verbose eprintln! statements from:
  - MIDI synthesizer (note on/off messages)
  - Audio graph (clip addition, playback stats)
  - Track manager (creation, deletion messages)
- Kept error messages for actual debugging needs

**Files Modified:**
- `engine/src/synth.rs` (-10 lines)
- `engine/src/audio_graph.rs` (-15 lines)
- `engine/src/track.rs` (-3 lines)
- `ui/lib/widgets/library_panel.dart` (-4 lines)

## Technical Details

### MIDI Clip Synchronization Flow
```
Piano Roll (Dart)
    ↓ Note edited
_onMidiClipUpdated()
    ↓ Check existing clip
_scheduleMidiClipPlayback()
    ↓
    ├─ Reuse clip? → clearMidiClip(rustClipId)
    └─ New clip? → createMidiClip()
    ↓
addMidiNoteToClip() (for each note)
    ↓
addMidiClipToTrack(trackId, clipId, startTime)
    ↓
Rust Audio Engine Timeline
```

### Track Deletion Cleanup Flow
```
User deletes track
    ↓
deleteTrack(trackId)
    ↓
    ├─ all_notes_off() → Stop active synthesizer voices
    ├─ remove_midi_clips_for_track(trackId) → Remove from global collection
    └─ track_manager.remove_track(trackId) → Delete track
    ↓
_onTrackDeleted(trackId) [Dart]
    ↓
    ├─ Clear _midiClips entries
    ├─ Remove _dartToRustClipIds mappings
    └─ Clear current editing clip
```

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing Performed
- ✅ Created MIDI track, added 4 notes → notes play correctly
- ✅ Edited notes (add/delete) → reuses same clip, no duplicates
- ✅ Deleted track → no stuck notes, complete silence
- ✅ Multiple create/delete cycles → no audio artifacts
- ✅ New project → properly clears all MIDI state
- ✅ Load project → restores MIDI clip mappings correctly

### Before/After Comparison

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| MIDI playback | ❌ No sound | ✅ Notes play correctly |
| Note editing | ❌ Creates duplicate clips | ✅ Updates existing clip |
| Track deletion | ❌ Stuck notes keep playing | ✅ Complete silence |
| Console output | ❌ 10+ messages per note | ✅ Clean (errors only) |

## Known Limitations Resolved

From M6 completion doc:
- ~~**MIDI Clip Playback:** Notes can be edited but not played back from timeline yet~~ ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Remaining Limitations

1. **MIDI Recording:** Not yet implemented (planned for future)
2. **Quantize:** Not yet implemented
3. **MIDI Clip Duplication:** Not yet implemented
4. **MIDI Export:** Cannot export MIDI clips to .mid files

---

## Conclusion

M6.1 successfully resolves all critical MIDI playback and cleanup issues:
- MIDI notes now play back correctly from the timeline
- Track management is clean with no audio artifacts
- User experience is smooth with minimal console noise

The MIDI workflow is now fully functional and ready for production use.
