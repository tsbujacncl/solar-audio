- [x] Added M5 state: `_currentProjectPath`, `_currentProjectName`
- [x] FFI bindings in `audio_engine.dart`

### Deferred to Later ‚è∏Ô∏è

#### Rust: Autosave ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED
- [ ] Implement autosave timer (every 2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Save to temp location: `~/.solar/autosave/`
- [ ] Don't interrupt audio thread

#### Flutter: Autosave Recovery ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED
- [ ] On app launch: check for autosave files
- [ ] If found, show dialog: "Recover unsaved project?"
- [ ] Load autosave or discard

#### Flutter: Export Dialog ‚è∏Ô∏è PARTIAL
- [x] Basic export dialog created
- [ ] Progress bar during export
- [ ] Format options (16/24-bit, sample rate)

#### Flutter: Unsaved Changes Indicator ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED
- [ ] Show unsaved changes indicator (dot in title bar)
- [ ] Track dirty state

### Known Limitations
- ‚è≥ **MIDI clip serialization** - Uses Note On/Off events, needs conversion
- ‚è≥ **Clip restoration to tracks** - Clips saved but not yet restored
- ‚è≥ **WAV export** - Offline rendering not implemented
- ‚è≥ **MP3 export** - Deferred (need encoder)
- ‚è≥ **Stems export** - Deferred

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Save project to `.solar` folder - **COMPLETE & TESTED**
‚úÖ Load project and restore all state - **COMPLETE & TESTED**
‚è∏Ô∏è Autosave runs every 2-3 minutes - **DEFERRED**
‚è∏Ô∏è Recover project after crash - **DEFERRED**
‚è∏Ô∏è Export to WAV/MP3 - **STUB ONLY (Deferred)**
‚è∏Ô∏è Export stems (each track as separate file) - **DEFERRED**
‚è∏Ô∏è Exported audio sounds identical to in-app playback - **DEFERRED**

### Test Results ‚úÖ
- **Save/Load:** All tracks, effects, and parameters persist correctly
- **File structure:** `.solar` folder with `project.json` and `audio/` subfolder working
- **Mixer integration:** Tracks appear correctly after load (bug fixed)
- **Effects:** All 6 effect types save/load with parameters intact
- **Tested by:** User on October 26, 2025

**See:** `docs/M5/M5_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for full details

### Risks & Mitigations
- **JSON gets huge for large projects** ‚Üí Compress or use binary format later (v1.1)
- **Export is slow** ‚Üí Show progress bar, run in background thread
- **File paths break on load** ‚Üí Use relative paths, validate on load

## M5.5: UI Redesign (October 26, 2025)

**Goal:** Transform UI from basic dark theme to professional 3-panel DAW layout with light grey theme.

**Duration:** 1 day
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

### What Was Implemented

#### New Layout Structure
- ‚úÖ **3-Panel Layout:** Library (left) + Timeline (center) + Mixer (right)
- ‚úÖ **LibraryPanel Widget:** 4 categories (Sounds, Instruments, Effects, Plug-Ins)
- ‚úÖ **Always-Visible Mixer:** Mixer panel permanently visible on right (300px)
- ‚úÖ **BottomPanel Widget:** Tabbed interface (Piano Roll, FX Chain, Virtual Piano)
- ‚úÖ **TrackHeader Widget:** Track headers in timeline with S/M buttons and level meters
- ‚úÖ **Consolidated Transport Bar:** Logo, controls, and file/mixer buttons in single bar

#### Light Grey Theme (Ableton-Style)
- ‚úÖ **Side Panels:** Medium grey (#707070) for library, mixer, transport, bottom panel
- ‚úÖ **Center Timeline:** Light grey (#909090) - lighter than sides to draw focus
- ‚úÖ **Dark Text:** All text changed from light grey to dark grey/black (#202020) for contrast
- ‚úÖ **Borders:** Light grey (#909090) instead of dark
- ‚úÖ **Status Bar:** Darker grey (#606060) to anchor bottom

#### Color Palette Documentation
```
Side Panels (Library, Mixer, Transport):
  Background: #707070 (medium grey)
  Headers:    #656565 (slightly darker)
  Borders:    #909090 (light grey)

Center Timeline:
  Background: #909090 (light grey)
  Tracks:     #9A9A9A (even lighter)
  Borders:    #AAAAAA (subtle)
  Grid:       #A0A0A0

Text (Dark on Light):
  Primary:    #202020 (very dark grey)
  Secondary:  #353535 (dark grey)
  Tertiary:   #505050 (medium-dark)
  Icons:      #404040

Accent Colors (unchanged):
  Green:   #4CAF50
  Red:     #FF5722
  Yellow:  #FFC107
  Blue:    #2196F3
```

### Files Created
1. `ui/lib/widgets/library_panel.dart` - Left sidebar browser
2. `ui/lib/widgets/track_header.dart` - Timeline track headers
3. `ui/lib/widgets/bottom_panel.dart` - Tabbed bottom panel

### Files Modified
1. `ui/lib/screens/daw_screen.dart` - 3-column layout
2. `ui/lib/widgets/transport_bar.dart` - Logo + file/mixer buttons
3. `ui/lib/widgets/mixer_panel.dart` - Always-visible, reduced width
4. `ui/lib/widgets/timeline_view.dart` - Multi-track with headers
5. `ui/lib/widgets/bottom_panel.dart` - Tab integration
6. All widgets updated with light grey color scheme

### Design Decisions
- **Light theme chosen** for better visibility and modern aesthetic (similar to Ableton Live)
- **Center focus:** Timeline lighter than side panels to draw attention to workspace
- **Dark text:** Better contrast and readability on light backgrounds
- **Panel proportions:** Library 12% | Timeline 63% | Mixer 25%
- **Single transport bar:** Logo moved from AppBar to transport bar for cleaner layout

### Future UI Enhancements
See "UI/UX Enhancement Roadmap" section below for planned improvements in M7-M9.

## M5.5: UI Polish & Resizable Panels

**Goal:** Professional UI with resizable panels and layout persistence.

**Duration:** 1 week
**Deliverable:** Draggable panel dividers, sizes saved per project, master track at bottom.

### Tasks Completed

#### Master Track Repositioning
- [x] Move master track to bottom of timeline
- [x] Move master track to bottom of mixer panel
- [x] Use Spacer widget to push master to bottom
- [x] Ensure master stays at bottom even with no other tracks

#### Resizable Panel Dividers
- [x] Create ResizableDivider widget (vertical/horizontal)
- [x] Add divider between Library and Timeline (drag to resize library width)
- [x] Add divider between Timeline and Mixer (drag to resize mixer width)
- [x] Add divider between Timeline and Bottom Panel (drag to resize bottom height)
- [x] Implement double-click to collapse/expand functionality
- [x] Add hover effects (highlight, cursor change)
- [x] Add min/max size constraints

#### UI Layout Persistence
- [x] Create ui_layout.json format (version, panel_sizes, panel_collapsed)
- [x] Save panel sizes on project save
- [x] Load panel sizes on project open
- [x] Gracefully handle missing ui_layout.json (use defaults)

#### UI Improvements
- [x] Move zoom controls from bottom bar to top-right corner (+40px vertical space)
- [x] Replace bottom Audio/MIDI buttons with + button in mixer header
- [x] Add dropdown menu for track creation (Audio Track / MIDI Track)
- [x] Improve track creation UX (more discoverable for beginners)

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Panels can be resized by dragging dividers
‚úÖ Double-click dividers collapses/expands panels
‚úÖ Panel sizes persist across app restarts
‚úÖ Master track always at bottom of timeline and mixer
‚úÖ Timeline has +40px more vertical space (zoom bar removed)
‚úÖ Track creation is more discoverable (+ button vs hidden buttons)

### Files Modified
- `lib/widgets/resizable_divider.dart` (new)
- `lib/screens/daw_screen.dart` (added panel size state, save/load methods)
- `lib/widgets/timeline_view.dart` (master at bottom, zoom moved)
- `lib/widgets/track_mixer_panel.dart` (master at bottom, + button)
- `lib/widgets/mixer_panel.dart` (updated but not used in current UI)

### Design Decisions
- **Ableton-inspired dividers:** 1px subtle lines that highlight on hover (3px green when dragging)
- **Double-click to collapse:** Industry standard (Logic Pro, VS Code) - faster than dragging all the way
- **Per-project persistence:** Different projects may need different layouts (recording vs mixing)
- **Smart constraints:** Prevent panels from being too small (unusable) or too large (timeline crushed)
- **Cursor feedback:** Changes to resize cursor (‚Üî or ‚Üï) on hover for discoverability

### Testing Notes
- Tested on macOS with various panel sizes
- Verified persistence across app restarts
- Tested edge cases (collapsed panels, min/max constraints)
- All panel dividers working smoothly with good visual feedback

### Next Steps
Ready to start M6 (MIDI & Piano Roll) with improved UI foundation.

## M5.6: Track Duplication (October 29, 2025)

**Goal:** Add professional track duplication with full state copying (instruments, effects, clips).

**Duration:** 1 day
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

### What Was Implemented

#### Backend Enhancements (Rust)
- [x] **TrackSynthManager.copy_synth()** - Deep copies synthesizers with all parameters
- [x] **EffectManager.duplicate_effect()** - Creates independent effect instances
- [x] **Clone trait** - Added to all 6 effect types (EQ, Compressor, Reverb, Delay, Limiter, Chorus)
- [x] **Enhanced duplicate_track()** - Now copies instruments and deep copies effects
- [x] **Proper lock management** - Fixed deadlock issues with scoped lock acquisition

#### UI Enhancements (Flutter)
- [x] **Right-click context menu** - Added to track headers and mixer strips
- [x] **Duplicate menu option** - With copy icon and keyboard shortcut hint
- [x] **Delete menu option** - With confirmation dialog (already existed)
- [x] **Instrument mapping sync** - Flutter copies instrument data when track duplicated
- [x] **Callback system** - TrackMixerPanel notifies DAW screen of duplication

### What Gets Duplicated
When you duplicate a track, the following are copied:

‚úÖ **Track properties:**
- Name (with " Copy" suffix)
- Volume, pan, mute settings
- Track type (Audio/MIDI)

‚úÖ **Audio/MIDI clips:**
- All clips on the track (Arc references - efficient)
- Clip positions and durations

‚úÖ **Instrument assignment:**
- Full synthesizer state with all parameters
- Oscillator types, levels, detune
- Filter settings (cutoff, resonance, type)
- Envelope parameters (ADSR)

‚úÖ **Effects chain:**
- Independent copies of all effects
- All effect parameters preserved
- Each track has fully independent effect instances

‚ùå **Not copied (intentional):**
- Solo state (always false on new track)
- Armed state (always false on new track)

### Technical Highlights

**Lock Management:**
- Implemented proper lock scoping to prevent deadlocks
- Three-phase approach: (1) read source, (2) create track, (3) copy properties
- Each lock is acquired and released cleanly

**Effect Deep Copying:**
- Each effect instance is cloned (not shared)
- Changing effect parameters on one track doesn't affect the other
- Matches Ableton Live's duplication behavior

**Instrument Copying:**
- Copies all 12+ synth parameters
- Updates all voice instances with new parameters
- Maintains polyphony and voice state independence

### Files Modified
**Rust (engine/):**
1. `src/synth.rs` - Added copy_synth() method
2. `src/effects.rs` - Added Clone trait to all effects, duplicate_effect()
3. `src/api.rs` - Enhanced duplicate_track() with instrument and effect copying

**Flutter (ui/lib/):**
4. `widgets/track_header.dart` - Added context menu with duplicate/delete
5. `widgets/track_mixer_strip.dart` - Added context menu
6. `widgets/track_mixer_panel.dart` - Added onTrackDuplicated callback
7. `screens/daw_screen.dart` - Added _onTrackDuplicated() handler

### Usage
1. **Right-click** on any track (timeline header or mixer strip)
2. Select **"Duplicate"** from context menu
3. New track appears with:
   - Same instrument and all its settings ‚úÖ
   - Independent effects (change one, doesn't affect other) ‚úÖ
   - Same clips ‚úÖ
   - Same mixer settings ‚úÖ

**Just like Ableton Live!** üéπüéõÔ∏è

### Testing
- ‚úÖ Duplicate MIDI track with synthesizer ‚Üí instrument copied
- ‚úÖ Duplicate track with effects ‚Üí effects are independent
- ‚úÖ Adjust parameters on duplicated track ‚Üí original unaffected
- ‚úÖ No crashes or deadlocks
- ‚úÖ Builds successfully (Rust warnings only, no errors)

### Next Steps
Ready to start M6 (MIDI & Piano Roll) with complete track management features.

## Development Best Practices

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start each day** by reviewing this doc and checking off completed tasks
2. **Commit often** (every feature or bug fix)
3. **Write tests** for critical audio code (playback, recording, export)
4. **Profile performance** weekly (use `cargo flamegraph` for Rust, Dart DevTools for Flutter)
5. **Document decisions** (add notes to this doc or `ARCHITECTURE.md`)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests:** Rust DSP code (verify EQ frequency response, compressor gain reduction, etc.)
- **Integration tests:** FFI bridge (call Rust from Flutter, verify results)
- **Manual testing:** Play, record, mix, export ‚Äî test every milestone deliverable
- **Performance tests:** Measure CPU usage, memory, latency

### When You Get Stuck
- **Audio issues:** Check [Rust Audio Discourse](https://rust-audio.discourse.group/), CPAL GitHub issues
- **Flutter issues:** Flutter Discord, StackOverflow
- **FFI issues:** `flutter_rust_bridge` GitHub, examples repo
- **DSP algorithms:** Read "Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++" by Will Pirkle, or "The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing"

## Appendix: Key Technical Decisions

### Why Rust?
- Memory-safe (no segfaults on audio thread)
- Compiles to native + WASM (future-proof for web/mobile)
- Growing audio ecosystem (`cpal`, `symphonia`, `fundsp`, etc.)
- Fast and efficient

### Why Flutter?
- Cross-platform UI (macOS, iPad, web, mobile from one codebase)
- Fast iteration (hot reload)
- Good performance (Skia rendering)

### Why Firebase?
- Simple auth + cloud storage
- Free tier generous for early users
- Well-integrated with Flutter

### Why Local-First?
- Works offline
- Fast (no network latency)
- User owns their data
- Cloud is optional enhancement
