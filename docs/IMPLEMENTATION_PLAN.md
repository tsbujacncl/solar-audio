# Solar Audio ‚Äî Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Target:** v1 MVP (macOS + iPad)  
**Timeline:** 3‚Äì6 months (adjust based on availability)  
**Tech Stack:** Flutter (UI) + Rust (audio engine) + Firebase Firestore (cloud)

---

## Overview

This document breaks the MVP into **7 actionable milestones** (M1‚ÄìM7), each representing ~2‚Äì4 weeks of work. Each milestone is demoable and builds toward the full v1 feature set defined in `MVP_SPEC.md`.

**Development Philosophy:**
- Build **vertical slices** (end-to-end features) rather than horizontal layers
- Prototype early, refine later
- Ship each milestone in a working state (even if rough)
- Test on macOS first, iPad second

---

### **Phase 2: Core DAW Features** (M2‚ÄìM4, ~10 weeks)
Recording, MIDI editing, mixing, and effects. This is the "meat" of the DAW.

### **Phase 3: Persistence & Cloud** (M5‚ÄìM6, ~4 weeks)
Save/load projects, export audio, cloud snapshots, version history.

### **Phase 4: Polish & Launch** (M7, ~2 weeks)
Keyboard shortcuts, command palette, crash recovery, UI refinement, first beta release.

- [ ] Track dirty state

### Known Limitations
- ‚è≥ **MIDI clip serialization** - Uses Note On/Off events, needs conversion
- ‚è≥ **Clip restoration to tracks** - Clips saved but not yet restored
- ‚è≥ **WAV export** - Offline rendering not implemented
- ‚è≥ **MP3 export** - Deferred (need encoder)
- ‚è≥ **Stems export** - Deferred

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Save project to `.solar` folder - **COMPLETE & TESTED**
‚úÖ Load project and restore all state - **COMPLETE & TESTED**
‚è∏Ô∏è Autosave runs every 2-3 minutes - **DEFERRED**
‚è∏Ô∏è Recover project after crash - **DEFERRED**
‚è∏Ô∏è Export to WAV/MP3 - **STUB ONLY (Deferred)**
‚è∏Ô∏è Export stems (each track as separate file) - **DEFERRED**
‚è∏Ô∏è Exported audio sounds identical to in-app playback - **DEFERRED**

### Test Results ‚úÖ
- **Save/Load:** All tracks, effects, and parameters persist correctly
- **File structure:** `.solar` folder with `project.json` and `audio/` subfolder working
- **Mixer integration:** Tracks appear correctly after load (bug fixed)
- **Effects:** All 6 effect types save/load with parameters intact
- **Tested by:** User on October 26, 2025

**See:** `docs/M5/M5_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for full details

### Risks & Mitigations
- **JSON gets huge for large projects** ‚Üí Compress or use binary format later (v1.1)
- **Export is slow** ‚Üí Show progress bar, run in background thread
- **File paths break on load** ‚Üí Use relative paths, validate on load

## M7: Polish & Beta Launch

**Goal:** Add final UX polish, keyboard shortcuts, command palette, crash recovery, fix bugs.

**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Deliverable:** Stable, polished app ready for beta testers.

### Tasks

#### Flutter: Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] Implement shortcuts (see `MVP_SPEC.md` for list):
  - Space: Play/Stop
  - R: Record toggle
  - L: Loop on/off
  - Cmd+N: New project
  - Cmd+S: Save
  - Cmd+Shift+S: Save to Cloud
  - Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z: Undo/Redo

  - "Add Audio Track"
  - "Add MIDI Track"
  - "Quantise Selection"
  - "Split Clip"
  - "Export to WAV"
  - etc. (all major actions)
- [ ] Fuzzy search (type "exp" ‚Üí finds "Export to WAV")
- [ ] Execute command on Enter

- [ ] Click to preview (plays through default output)
- [ ] Drag sample to timeline to add clip
- [ ] Test: Click preview ‚Üí hear sample ‚Üí drag to timeline

#### Rust: Crash-Safe Recovery (Enhanced)
- [ ] Save app state to temp file every 1 minute (lighter than full autosave)
- [ ] On crash: write crash log to `~/.solar/crashes/`
- [ ] On relaunch: detect abnormal exit, offer recovery
- [ ] Test: Force crash ‚Üí relaunch ‚Üí verify recovery works

#### Flutter: Settings Panel *(Deferred from M2)*

  - [ ] Sample rate selector (44.1/48/96 kHz)
  - [ ] Buffer size selector (64/128/256/512 samples)
- [ ] Add "Recording" tab with:
  - [ ] Count-in bars selector (0/1/2/4)
  - [ ] Metronome volume slider
  - [ ] Default tempo setting
- [ ] Wire to existing FFI functions from M2

- [ ] Test: App feels polished and professional

#### Bug Fixes & Optimization
- [ ] Profile audio performance (aim for <5% CPU at idle, <30% with 16 tracks)
- [ ] Fix any crashes or hangs discovered during testing
- [ ] Test on multiple macOS versions (12, 13, 14)
- [ ] Test on iPad (if time permits, or defer to v1.1)

#### Documentation
- [ ] Update `README.md` with:
  - Installation instructions
  - Quick start guide
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Link to `MVP_SPEC.md`
- [ ] Add `CHANGELOG.md` (list features in v1)
- [ ] Create GitHub issues for known bugs and v1.1 features

#### Beta Testing Prep
- [ ] Set up TestFlight (for macOS/iPad beta distribution)
- [ ] Create feedback form (Google Form or Typeform)
- [ ] Write beta tester guide (PDF or web page)
- [ ] Invite 5-10 beta testers

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ All keyboard shortcuts work  
‚úÖ Command palette is fast and searchable  
‚úÖ Undo/redo works for all actions  
‚úÖ Clip gain handles adjust volume smoothly  
‚úÖ Sample preview plays before dragging to timeline  
‚úÖ App recovers from crashes  
‚úÖ UI is polished and bug-free  
‚úÖ Beta testers can install and use the app

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Too many bugs to fix in 2 weeks** ‚Üí Prioritize critical bugs, defer minor issues to v1.1
- **Performance issues on older Macs** ‚Üí Profile and optimize hot paths, reduce track limit if needed
- **Beta testers find major UX issues** ‚Üí Be prepared to iterate post-launch

## Post-M7: v1.1 Planning

After M7 ships, gather feedback and plan v1.1 features:

### Top Priorities for v1.1
1. **Time-stretch/warp** (elastic audio editing)
2. **Track freeze / bounce in place** (render plugins to audio)
3. **Collaboration** (soft real-time with per-clip locks)
4. **Web version** (edit/mix in browser, no recording)
5. **Mobile apps** (iOS, Android via same Rust codebase)
6. **Windows & Linux** (desktop builds)
7. **LUFS metering** (loudness standards)
8. **More samples & instruments** (guitars, bass, orchestral)
9. **CLAP plugin support**
10. **Group track folders**

---

## Development Best Practices

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start each day** by reviewing this doc and checking off completed tasks
2. **Commit often** (every feature or bug fix)
3. **Write tests** for critical audio code (playback, recording, export)
4. **Profile performance** weekly (use `cargo flamegraph` for Rust, Dart DevTools for Flutter)
5. **Document decisions** (add notes to this doc or `ARCHITECTURE.md`)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests:** Rust DSP code (verify EQ frequency response, compressor gain reduction, etc.)
- **Integration tests:** FFI bridge (call Rust from Flutter, verify results)
- **Manual testing:** Play, record, mix, export ‚Äî test every milestone deliverable
- **Performance tests:** Measure CPU usage, memory, latency

### When You Get Stuck
- **Audio issues:** Check [Rust Audio Discourse](https://rust-audio.discourse.group/), CPAL GitHub issues
- **Flutter issues:** Flutter Discord, StackOverflow
- **FFI issues:** `flutter_rust_bridge` GitHub, examples repo
- **DSP algorithms:** Read "Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++" by Will Pirkle, or "The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing"

---

## Appendix: Key Technical Decisions

### Why Rust?
- Memory-safe (no segfaults on audio thread)
- Compiles to native + WASM (future-proof for web/mobile)
- Growing audio ecosystem (`cpal`, `symphonia`, `fundsp`, etc.)
- Fast and efficient

### Why Flutter?
- Cross-platform UI (macOS, iPad, web, mobile from one codebase)
- Fast iteration (hot reload)
- Good performance (Skia rendering)

### Why Firebase?
- Simple auth + cloud storage
- Free tier generous for early users
- Well-integrated with Flutter

### Why Local-First?
- Works offline
- Fast (no network latency)
- User owns their data
- Cloud is optional enhancement

## Final Notes

This plan is **aggressive but achievable** if you work consistently (~15-20 hours/week). Adjust timelines based on your availability. The key is to **ship each milestone in a working state** ‚Äî even if rough ‚Äî and iterate.

**Good luck building Solar Audio! üåë‚òÄÔ∏è**
