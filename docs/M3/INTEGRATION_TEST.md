2. **Expected:**
   - All notes play (up to 16 simultaneous voices)
   - No crashes or audio glitches

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- Can play up to 16 simultaneous notes
- Voice stealing works smoothly
- No audio dropouts or glitches

---

## Test 4: ADSR Envelope Behavior

3. **Expected:**
   - Note starts at zero volume
   - Fades in quickly (~10ms attack)
   - Note has a quick "blip" sound

---

### Step 2: Test Sustain Phase

   - Note reaches full volume quickly
   - Volume stays consistent while held (sustain level ~70%)
   - No volume drift or wobble

---

### Step 3: Test Release Phase

1. **Hold a key** for 2 seconds
2. **Release the key**
3. **Expected:**

🎹 [MIDI] Found 0 MIDI input devices
✅ Audio graph initialized: M1: Audio graph initialized
🎵 Recording settings initialized:
   - Count-in: 2 bars
   - Tempo: 120.0 BPM

```

**Switching Waveforms:**

```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No sound when playing piano"

**Check:**
1. System volume is not muted
2. MIDI input is started (should happen automatically when piano opens)
3. Console shows "🎹 [SYNTH] Note On" messages
4. Try clicking the piano icon to close and reopen

**Fix:**
```bash
# Rebuild engine if library is stale
cd engine
cargo build --release
```

---

### "Keys don't light up when clicked"

**Check:**
1. You're clicking on the actual key area (not the label)
2. Virtual piano has focus (click anywhere on piano first)

**Note:** This is a minor visual bug, sound should still work.

---

### "Stuck notes - sound continues after releasing key"

**Check:**
1. Console shows matching Note On and Note Off messages
2. Try clicking the note again to re-trigger

**If persistent:**
```bash
# This is a bug - report it and restart the app
# Close piano, stop playback, reopen piano
```

---

### "Crackling or glitching audio"

**Check:**
1. CPU usage is reasonable (<30%)
2. No other audio-intensive apps running
3. Buffer size is adequate (default should work)

**Fix:**
```bash
# If crackling persists, increase audio buffer size in future release
# For now, reduce polyphony (play fewer simultaneous notes)
```

---

### "Piano doesn't appear when clicking icon"

**Check:**
1. Console for error messages
2. MIDI input manager initialized (should happen on app launch)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Restart the app
cd ui
flutter run -d macos
```

---

### "Keyboard keys don't trigger notes"

**Check:**
1. Virtual piano has **keyboard focus** (click on piano area first)
2. You're not in a text field
3. Caps Lock is off (shouldn't matter but try it)

**Fix:**
- Click anywhere on the piano to give it focus

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Expected Behavior (Not Bugs)

1. **Piano roll UI is missing** - Deferred to M3 second half
   - Can't see recorded MIDI notes on timeline yet
   - Workaround: Use virtual piano for immediate playback

2. **Can't record MIDI yet** - UI integration pending
   - Recording backend is ready (Rust)
   - Just needs Flutter UI wiring
   - Workaround: Virtual piano works for live performance

3. **No drum samples** - Drum sampler deferred
   - Only synthesizer sounds available
   - Workaround: Use saw/square wave for percussive sounds

4. **No MIDI file import/export** - Future feature
   - Can't load .mid files yet
   - Workaround: Use virtual piano or hardware MIDI input

5. **Quantization is hard-coded to 120 BPM** - Minor bug
   - If you change project tempo, quantization doesn't adapt yet
   - Easy fix: needs tempo plumbing from UI to backend

---

## Next Steps After Test Passes

Once M3 integration test passes:

### Immediate Next Steps (If Continuing M3)
1. Wire MIDI recording to UI (add "Record MIDI" button)
2. Display MIDI clips on timeline (basic rectangles)
3. Test MIDI recording → playback workflow

### Or Move to M4 (Recommended)
1. Implement multi-track system
2. Add volume/pan controls per track
3. Build mixer panel UI
4. Add basic effects (EQ, reverb, compressor)

Piano roll and step sequencer can be added in v1.1 or after M7.
