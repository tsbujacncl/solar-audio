# Solar Audio - MVP Specification (v1.0)

**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** In Development (M5.5.1 Complete - UI + Resizable Panels, M6 Ready to Start)
**Target Platform:** macOS 12+ (Monterey or later)

---

## Philosophy

**Solar Audio is:**
- **Beautiful, simple, cross-platform DAW** (macOS first, iPad/iPhone later)
- **GarageBand ease-of-use + Ableton power** (accessible to beginners, powerful for pros)
- **Hide complexity, focus on music-making** (no overwhelming options, clean UI)
- **Audio recording first, MIDI second** (optimized for recording, mixing, editing)

**Core Values:**
- ☀️ **Free forever** - No paywalls, no track limits, no subscriptions
- 🌍 **Open-source** - GPL v3, community-driven, transparent
- 🎨 **Modern design** - Beautiful UI, Ableton-inspired, not dated
- 🚀 **Cross-platform** - macOS, iPad, iPhone, Web (future: Windows, Linux)
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** - No data selling, no tracking, local-first

---

## Core Features (v1.0)

### Audio Engine

**Sample Rate & Bit Depth:**
- Auto-detect from audio interface (44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz)
- Fallback to 44.1kHz if no interface detected
- 24-bit internal processing (high quality)

**Buffer Size:**
- User-selectable in Preferences: 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 samples
- Default: 256 samples (good balance of latency vs. CPU)
- Lower = less latency (good for recording)
- Higher = more CPU headroom (good for mixing)

**CPU Management:**
- Warning banner when CPU overloads
- Audio glitches (like Ableton) but keeps playing
- Suggests: "Increase buffer size or freeze tracks"

**Master Limiter:**
- Always on by default (-0.3dB ceiling)
- Transparent, prevents clipping
- Advanced users can disable in Preferences

---
