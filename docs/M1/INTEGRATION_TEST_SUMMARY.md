## 🚀 Quick Start - Test Now!

The Flutter app is already running! Here's how to test:

### Step 1: Test M0 (Verification)
- Click **"Play Beep"** button
- You should hear a 1-second 440Hz tone
- ✅ This confirms basic FFI is working

### Step 2: Initialize Audio Graph
- Click **"1. Initialize Audio Graph"**
- Button turns green ✓
- Status: "M1: Audio graph initialized"

### Step 3: Load Test File
- Click **"2. Load Test File"**
- Button turns green ✓
- Status: "Loaded clip 0 (3.00s)"

### Step 4: Play Audio!
- Click the **▶ Play** button (green)
- 🎵 You should hear a 3-second 440Hz tone
- Watch the playhead position update in real-time!

### Step 5: Test Controls
- **⏸ Pause**: Audio pauses, playhead freezes
- **▶ Play**: Resumes from pause position
- **⏹ Stop**: Audio stops, playhead resets to 0.000s

---

## 📊 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators
- All buttons respond to clicks
- State changes reflected visually (colors, checkmarks)
- Audio plays clearly without glitches
- Playhead updates smoothly (50ms intervals)
- Status messages show detailed feedback
- Console shows FFI binding logs

### ❌ Potential Issues
- **"Library file NOT found"**: Run `cd engine && cargo build --release`
- **"Failed to load file"**: Check `~/Downloads/test.wav` exists
- **No sound**: Check system volume and Sound settings
- **Playhead frozen**: Only updates during playback (expected)

---

## 🎯 Test Checklist

### M0 Verification
- [ ] M0 beep button plays 1-second tone
- [ ] Status message updates correctly
- [ ] No FFI errors in console

### M1 Integration
- [ ] Audio graph initializes successfully
- [ ] Test file loads (shows duration)
- [ ] Play button starts audio playback
- [ ] Can hear the 440Hz test tone
- [ ] Playhead position updates during playback
- [ ] Pause button freezes playhead
- [ ] Resume continues from pause position
- [ ] Stop button resets playhead to 0.000s
- [ ] No audio glitches or crackling
- [ ] Console shows clean FFI logs

### Performance
- [ ] UI remains responsive during playback
- [ ] Playhead updates smoothly
- [ ] No dropped frames or stuttering
- [ ] CPU usage reasonable (check Activity Monitor)

## 🎉 What This Proves

### End-to-End Integration Works!
✅ Rust engine compiles and runs
✅ FFI bridge connects Dart to Rust
✅ Audio files load and decode correctly
✅ Real-time playback with mixing works
✅ Transport controls respond correctly
✅ Playhead tracking is sample-accurate
✅ Memory management is safe (no leaks)

### Ready for Next Phase
Now that core integration is proven, we can build:
1. **Timeline UI** - Visual representation of audio
2. **Waveform Rendering** - Using the peaks API we built
3. **Drag & Drop** - Easy file import
4. **Full Transport Bar** - Polished controls

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App won't launch
```bash
cd ui
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d macos
```

### "Library file NOT found"
```bash
cd engine
cargo build --release
ls -lh target/release/libengine.dylib  # Verify it exists
```

### No test.wav file
```bash
python3 generate_test_wav.py
ls -lh ~/Downloads/test.wav  # Verify it exists
```

### Want different test audio
Edit `generate_test_wav.py` and change:
- `duration_seconds` - Length of audio
- `frequency_hz` - Pitch (440 = A4, 261.63 = C4)
- `amplitude` - Volume (0.3 = safe, 1.0 = max)

---

## 📈 Next Steps

Once testing is complete and everything works:

1. **Proceed to Approach 2** - Build Flutter UI components
2. **Start with Transport Controls** - Already functionally complete in test UI!
3. **Add Timeline** - Visual canvas for clips
4. **Implement Waveform** - Use `getWaveformPeaks()` API
5. **Add Drag & Drop** - File import functionality

---

## 📞 Need Help?

Check the logs in the Flutter console. Most issues will show:
- FFI binding errors (at startup)
- File loading errors (when clicking "Load Test File")
- Audio engine errors (during playback)

All errors are logged with ❌ emoji prefix for easy searching.
